"""
This module implements a threadpool which allows scripts that require
performing concurrent jobs, an efficient and thread safe way to do this.

The two classes available are ThreadPool and Thread. ThreadPool is the
controller class and contains a collection of Thread objects, which must be
subclassed.
Any thread can add a job to the ThreadPool by calling its append() method.
The pool will add this task to the jobqueue and activate a sleeping thread, if
available. In case no thread is directly available, the job will be handled by
the first free thread.

The Thread class must be subclassed and passed to the ThreadPool's constructor.
The subclass should implement a do(args) method, which will receive as its
argument the job. Please note that providing mutable variables to the jobqueue
may cause thread unsafety!
